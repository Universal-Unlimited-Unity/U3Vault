## Overview

U3Vault is a full-stack HR and employee management platform designed for organizations that need a secure, centralized vault for employee data. It provides a clean **Streamlit** frontend for both admins and employees, backed by a robust **FastAPI** REST API and a **PostgreSQL** database.

Whether you're managing employee records, tracking attendance, handling leave requests, or storing contract documents, U3Vault has you covered — all protected by industry-standard JWT authentication and bcrypt password hashing.

---

## Key Features

### 🔐 Security
- **JWT Token Authentication** — Stateless, expiring tokens (60-minute default) issued via `python-jose` with HS256 algorithm
- **Bcrypt Password Hashing** — Passwords are hashed using `passlib` with bcrypt; plain-text passwords are never stored
- **Strong Password Policy** — Enforced password requirements: minimum 10 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit
- **Token Verification Endpoints** — Dedicated endpoints to validate active tokens and re-authenticate users before sensitive actions

### 👥 Role-Based Access Control
Three distinct roles with scoped permissions:
| Role | Capabilities |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access — manage company settings, create/delete employees |
| **Manager** | Manage employees, approve/reject leave requests, view attendance analytics |
| **Employee** | View own profile, update own info, submit leave requests, view own attendance |

### 🏢 Employee Management
- Full **CRUD operations** for employee records
- Rich employee profiles: name, job title, department, role, supervisor, gender, date of birth, address, and employment details
- Support for multiple **contract types** (Employee, Temporary, Intern) and **employment types** (Full-time, Part-time)
- Employee **status tracking**: Active, On Leave, Inactive, Resigned
- Profile **photo upload** and **contract PDF** storage

### 📅 Leave Request System
- Employees can submit leave requests directly from the interface
- Managers can view, approve, or reject requests via a dedicated management endpoint
- Status tracking for all leave requests

### 📊 Attendance Tracking
- Log daily attendance for all employees
- Date-conflict detection to prevent duplicate entries
- Filter attendance records by date range
- **Analytics & Reports**: global and per-employee attendance analytics
- **Visual Charts**: trend plots and pie charts (returned as PNG images)
- PDF report generation for attendance data

### 📄 Document Management
- Store and retrieve employee **contract PDFs**
- Shared volume ensures both backend and frontend can access uploaded files seamlessly

### ✅ Data Validation
- **Phone number validation** with international country code support (`pydantic-extra-types` + `phonenumbers`)
- **Email validation** via Pydantic's `EmailStr`
- **Enum-enforced fields** for gender, status, contract type, employment type, and role
- Full request body validation through Pydantic models on every endpoint

### 🏗️ Company Management
- Register your company with a unique **auto-generated slug** (used as a tenant identifier for employee login)
- Company slug lookup and password update support
- Multi-tenant ready architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Universal-Unlimited-Unity/U3Vault.git
   cd U3Vault
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**

   Review and update the backend environment file before starting:

   ```bash
   # backend/.env
   POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"
   POSTGRES_DB="vault"
   TOKEN_EXP_MIN="60"
   TOKEN_KEY="your_secret_key"
   ALGO="HS256"
   ```

   > ⚠️ Change `TOKEN_KEY` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to strong, unique values before deploying.

3. **Start all services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   Docker Compose will spin up three containers:
   - `db` — PostgreSQL 15 database
   - `backend` — FastAPI application
   - `frontend` — Streamlit web interface

4. **Access the application**

   | Service | URL |
   |---------|-----|
   | **Frontend (Streamlit)** | http://localhost:8501 |
   | **Backend API** | http://localhost:8000 |
   | **API Docs (Swagger)** | http://localhost:8000/docs |

### Database Initialization

The database tables are created automatically on first startup via SQLAlchemy. No manual migration steps are required.

### Development Mode (Live Reload)

The `docker-compose.yml` includes a `develop.watch` configuration for live sync:

```bash
docker-compose watch
```

This will sync file changes from your local machine into the containers and rebuild automatically when `reqs.txt` changes.

---

## Configuration

All configuration is managed via the `backend/.env` file:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `POSTGRES_USER` | PostgreSQL username | `postgres` |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | *(set your own)* |
| `POSTGRES_DB` | Database name | `vault` |
| `TOKEN_EXP_MIN` | JWT token expiration in minutes | `60` |
| `TOKEN_KEY` | Secret key for signing JWT tokens | *(set your own)* |
| `ALGO` | JWT signing algorithm | `HS256` |
